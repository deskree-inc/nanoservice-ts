title: Improving CLI
---

Welcome to the `Blok` CLI contribution guide! This document outlines the best practices for contributing to the CLI, ensuring consistency, usability, and maintainability.

---

## **Overview**  
The CLI (`@nanoservice-ts/cli`) is a core tool for managing workflows, nodes, and deployments. Contributions should focus on:  
✅ **Enhancing Developer Experience** – Commands should be intuitive and efficient.  
✅ **Maintaining Consistency** – Follow existing patterns and structures.  
✅ **Ensuring Robustness** – Proper error handling, validations, and tests are mandatory.  

---

## **Getting Started**  
<Tip> Make sure you follow the recommendations on how to set up local environment and steps to complete before committing your changes. To learn more [visit](/docs/c/overview/how-to-contribute)</Tip>
### **1. Setup the Development Environment**  
Clone the repository and navigate to the CLI package:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deskree-inc/nanoservice-ts.git
cd packages/cli
npm install
```

### **2. CLI Structure**  
The CLI follows a modular command structure:  
```
/packages/cli
 ├── /src
 │    ├── commands/  # Individual CLI commands
 │    ├── services/  # Utility services
 │    ├── index.ts   # CLI entry point
 │    ├── config.ts  # CLI configurations
 │    ├── logger.ts  # Logging utilities
 ├── /tests          # Unit tests for CLI commands
 ├── package.json    # CLI dependencies and scripts
```

---

## **Adding a New CLI Command**  
All commands should be placed inside `/src/commands/` and registered in `index.ts`.  

## **Coding Guidelines**  
### **1. Naming Conventions**  
- Commands should use **kebab-case** (e.g., `deploy-workflow`, `init-project`).
- Functions should use **camelCase** (e.g., `fetchNodes()`).
- Files should use **PascalCase.ts** (e.g., `ListNodes.ts`).

### **2. Command Structure**  
Each command should include:  
✅ **A clear description** (`.description()`).  
✅ **Error handling** using `try/catch`.  
✅ **Logging** (`logSuccess()`, `logError()`).  
✅ **Async execution** (`await` where necessary).  

### **3. Logging & Feedback**  
Use **consistent logging** to improve UX:  
```typescript
import { logSuccess, logError } from '../logger';
logSuccess('Action completed successfully!');
logError('Something went wrong!');
```

---

## **Submitting a Pull Request**  
### **1. Open a New Branch**  
Follow branch naming conventions:  
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-list-nodes
```

### **2. Ensure Code Quality**  
Run linting and formatting checks:  
```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### **3. Submit a PR**  
- Provide a **clear description** of the change.  
- Reference any related issues.  
- Request a **review from maintainers** before merging.
