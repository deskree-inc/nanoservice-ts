## Starting

This guide will walk you through setting up your Nanoservice-TS development environment and creating your first nanoservice-based application. We aim to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Nanoservice-TS is built on Node.js. We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** (or **yarn**): npm is included with Node.js. If you prefer yarn, ensure it is installed.

## Installation

The primary way to interact with Nanoservice-TS and manage your projects is through our Command Line Interface (CLI), `nanoctl`.

You don't need to install `nanoctl` globally to start. You can use `npx` to run the latest version directly:

## Creating Your First Project

Let's create a new Nanoservice-TS project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create project
```

The CLI will guide you through the project creation process with an interactive interface:

┌   Create a New Project 
│
◇  Please provide a name for the project
│  nano-service
│
◇  Select the trigger to install
│  HTTP
│
◇  Select the runtimes to install
│  NodeJS
│
◇  Install the examples?
│  NO
│
◇  Project "nano-service" created successfully

Trigger: HTTP

Change to the project directory: cd nano-service
Run the command "npm run dev" to start the development server.
You can test the project in your browser at http://localhost:4000/health-check
For more documentation, visit https://nanoservice.xyz/
```

This will create a new directory with the name you provided, containing a fully configured Nanoservice-TS project.

## Project Structure

After creating a new project, you'll have a directory structure like this:

```

```

## Running Your First Application

The newly created project already includes a pre-configured example workflow called `countries-helper` that fetches country data from an API. To run it:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nano-service
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Note that you don't need to run `npm install` as this is already handled during project creation.

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000/countries-helper
   ```

   Or use a tool like curl:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/countries-helper
   ```

You should receive a JSON response with country data. The name of the workflow file corresponds to the endpoint URL, so `countries-helper` is accessible at `/countries-helper`.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to set up and run a Nanoservice-TS project, you can explore further:

*   Learn more about [Nodes](./nodes) - the building blocks of your application.
*   Understand [Workflows](./workflows) in more detail.
*   Discover how [Triggers](./triggers) initiate your workflows.
*   Dive into the [Context Object](./context) for data sharing.
*   Explore the available [Examples](../examples/index) for more complex use cases.
*   Deepen your knowledge with the [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/overview) section.

Happy building!
