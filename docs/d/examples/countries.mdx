title: Countries API Example
---

This example demonstrates how to create a simple workflow that fetches data from an external API using the built-in `@nanoservice-ts/api-call` node. The workflow retrieves a list of countries and their capitals from a public API and returns the data as a JSON response.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, ensure you have:

- A Nanoservice-ts project set up with the HTTP trigger
- Node.js (v14 or later) and npm installed

If you haven't created a project yet, you can do so with:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create project
```

Follow the prompts:
- Provide a name for your project
- Select "HTTP" as the trigger
- Select "NodeJS" as the runtime
- Choose "YES" when asked to install examples

## Workflow Structure

The Countries workflow is defined in `workflows/json/countries.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "World Countries",
  "description": "Workflow description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "trigger": {
    "http": {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/",
      "accept": "application/json"
    }
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "get-countries-api",
      "node": "@nanoservice-ts/api-call",
      "type": "module"
    }
  ],
  "nodes": {
    "get-countries-api": {
      "inputs": {
        "url": "https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/capital",
        "method": "GET",
        "headers": {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "responseType": "application/json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This workflow:
1. Is triggered by an HTTP GET request to the root path (`/`)
2. Uses the built-in `@nanoservice-ts/api-call` node to make a GET request to the countries API
3. Returns the API response directly to the client

## Running the Example

1. **Start your Nanoservice-ts application**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the Countries workflow**:

   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000/countries
   ```

   Or use curl:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/countries
   ```

   You should receive a JSON response containing a list of countries and their capitals.

## How It Works

The Countries workflow demonstrates several key concepts in Nanoservice-ts:

### HTTP Trigger

The workflow is triggered by an HTTP GET request to the specified path. In the workflow definition, this is configured in the `trigger` section:

```json
"trigger": {
  "http": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/",
    "accept": "application/json"
  }
}
```

### Built-in API Call Node

The workflow uses the `@nanoservice-ts/api-call` node, which is a built-in node that handles HTTP requests to external APIs. This node is configured with inputs specifying the URL, method, headers, and expected response type:

```json
"nodes": {
  "get-countries-api": {
    "inputs": {
      "url": "https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/capital",
      "method": "GET",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "responseType": "application/json"
    }
  }
}
```

### API Call Node Implementation

The `@nanoservice-ts/api-call` node is implemented as follows:

```typescript
import {
  type INanoServiceResponse,
  type JsonLikeObject,
  NanoService,
  NanoServiceResponse,
} from "@nanoservice-ts/runner";
import { type Context, GlobalError } from "@nanoservice-ts/shared";
import { inputSchema } from "./inputSchema";
import { runApiCall } from "./util";

export type InputType = {
  method: string;
  url: string;
  headers: JsonLikeObject;
  responseType: string;
  body: JsonLikeObject;
};

export default class ApiCall extends NanoService<InputType> {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.inputSchema = inputSchema;
    this.outputSchema = {};
  }

  async handle(ctx: Context, inputs: InputType): Promise<INanoServiceResponse> {
    const response: NanoServiceResponse = new NanoServiceResponse();

    try {
      const method = inputs.method;
      const url = inputs.url;
      const headers = inputs.headers;
      const responseType = inputs.responseType;
      const body = inputs.body || ctx.response.data;

      const result = await runApiCall(url, method, headers, body as JsonLikeObject, responseType);
      response.setSuccess(result);
    } catch (error: unknown) {
      const nodeError: GlobalError = new GlobalError((error as Error).message);
      nodeError.setCode(500);
      nodeError.setStack((error as Error).stack);
      nodeError.setName(this.name);
      response.setError(nodeError);
    }

    return response;
  }
}
```

This node:
1. Takes inputs for the API call (method, URL, headers, response type, and optional body)
2. Makes the API call using the `runApiCall` utility function
3. Returns the result on success or an error on failure

### Response Handling

The response from the external API is automatically returned to the client. The Nanoservice-ts framework handles the serialization of the response to JSON and sets the appropriate content type headers.

## Customizing the Example

You can customize the Countries workflow in several ways:

### Change the API Endpoint

Modify the `url` in the node inputs to fetch data from a different API:

```json
"inputs": {
  "url": "https://your-api-endpoint.com/data",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "responseType": "application/json"
}
```

### Add Query Parameters

Add query parameters to the URL to filter or customize the API response:

```json
"inputs": {
  "url": "https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/capital?filter=region&value=Europe",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "responseType": "application/json"
}
```

### Add Authentication

If the API requires authentication, add the necessary headers:

```json
"inputs": {
  "url": "https://api.example.com/data",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key"
  },
  "responseType": "application/json"
}
```

### Add Data Transformation

To transform the API response before returning it to the client, you can add a custom node to the workflow:

1. Create a new node for data transformation
2. Add it as a step after the API call
3. Configure it to process the data from the API call

## Conclusion

The Countries workflow example demonstrates how to use Nanoservice-ts to create a simple API proxy. By leveraging the built-in `@nanoservice-ts/api-call` node, you can easily integrate external APIs into your applications without writing complex HTTP client code.

This pattern can be extended to create more sophisticated workflows that combine data from multiple sources, transform data, and implement business logic.
