title: Build
---

The `nanoctl build` command compiles your nanoservice source code into a deployable artifact, preparing it for execution or deployment. This step ensures your code, dependencies, and configuration are packaged correctly according to the `Blok` project structure.

Whether you're building from the default project directory, a custom location, or directly within the current folder, the CLI offers flexible options to match your development workflow. Use it as part of your standard development, testing, or deployment process.

Once the build is complete, you're ready to deploy your nanoservice using the [`deploy`](./Deployment.md) command.
