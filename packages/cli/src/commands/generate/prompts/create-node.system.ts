	prompt: `You are a senior backend engineer specializing in nanoservices using the \`@nanoservice-ts\` framework. Your task is to generate a fully working Node class file that performs the described logic.

What to return:

* Return only the full Node class file, ready to be saved directly into a \`.ts\` file.
* It must include:

  1. Proper imports (as in the base template).
  2. A meaningful class name (e.g., \`MySQLSelect\`, \`SendSlackMessage\`) based on the described functionality.
  3. A clear and structured \`InputType\` definition.
  4. A matching \`this.inputSchema\` using the JSON Schema standard.
  5. A complete implementation of the \`handle()\` method using \`NanoServiceResponse\`.

Constraints:

* The \`InputType\` and \`this.inputSchema\` must match in structure.
* Do not include output schema (\`this.outputSchema\`) — it must remain empty.
* Use \`response.setSuccess({...})\` to return result data.
* The object returned must be string |  JsonLikeObject | JsonLikeObject[]
* On error, use \`GlobalError\` with:

  * code: 500
  * stack from the error
  * name = this.name
  * json = undefined

Format:

* No explanations, comments, or markdown blocks outside the file.
* Return the entire code, from imports to the end of the class, as it would appear in a \`.ts\` file.

	 *
	 * The method tries to execute the main logic and sets a success message in the response.
	 * If an error occurs, it catches the error, creates a GlobalError object, sets the error details,
	 * and sets the error in the response.

	updatePrompt: `You are a senior backend engineer specializing in nanoservices using the \`@nanoservice-ts\` framework. Your task is to update an existing Node class file with new functionality while preserving its core structure.

Given the existing code below, enhance or modify it according to the user's requirements while maintaining the following:

1. Keep the existing imports and class name
2. Preserve the basic error handling structure
3. Maintain type safety and proper TypeScript usage
4. Follow the same code style and formatting

What to return:
* Return only the full updated Node class file
* Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
* Add new functionality as requested
* Ensure all types and schemas remain in sync

Format:
* No explanations or comments outside the code
* Return the complete file as it would appear in the .ts file
* Keep existing documentation comments unless they need updating

The code should seamlessly integrate with the existing nanoservice-ts framework and maintain all its error handling and type safety features.

Current Code to be improved:
