## About The Project  

**nanoservice-ts** is an open-source framework designed to simplify backend development by enabling developers to implement the **nanoservices architecture** effortlessly. Built with **TypeScript**, this framework helps you create lightweight, modular, and scalable backend systems that adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.  

By combining an intuitive API, programmatic workflow orchestration, and powerful tooling, nanoservice-ts allows you to focus on writing business logic while abstracting the complexities of infrastructure, scaling, and resource management.  

### Key Highlights  

- **Nanoservices Architecture**: Divide backend logic into reusable, single-responsibility units that are easy to manage, scale, and debug.  
- **Developer-Friendly Tools**: Use TypeScript-powered APIs, templates, and a CLI for quick project setup and workflow creation.  
- **Efficient and Scalable**: Built to support dynamic workflows with containerized execution and independent scalability for each nanoservice.  
- **Community-Driven**: Collaborate, share, and benefit from a growing library of community-created nodes and workflows.  

### Why nanoservice-ts?  

Modern backend development often suffers from over-engineered solutions, resource inefficiencies, and complex architectures. **nanoservice-ts** addresses these pain points by offering:  

- **Modular Design**: Reuse components across projects, reducing redundancy and improving productivity.  
- **Simplified Scaling**: Focus on scaling individual nanoservices based on real-time demands, optimizing resource usage.  
- **Flexibility**: Build workflows programmatically or using pre-built templates for common tasks like HTTP APIs, event processing, and scheduled jobs.  

With **nanoservice-ts**, backend development becomes modular, predictable, and future-proof, making it ideal for both small projects and large-scale systems.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To start developing your project, simply run:

```bash
  npx nanoctl@latest create project
```

And follow the instructions of the CLI

_For more information and examples, visit [Getting Started](https://nanoservice.xyz/docs/d/getting-started/nanoctl)_

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Creating Nodes & Workflows

* **Node** is a small functioning unit designed to perform a specific task within a workflow
* **Workflow** is a collection of nodes group together in a certain sequence to create a piece of business logic that starts with a trigger
* **Trigger** is an event or condition that starts the execution of a workflow

_For a step-by-step example of how to use nodes, workflows, and triggers, visit [Quickstart](http://localhost:4000/docs/d/quickstart)_

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Running Workflows

To run the created workflow locally:

1. Start the runner via `npm run dev`
2. Use tools like POSTMAN, curl, or any HTTP client to test workflows at `http://localhost:4000/{workflow-name}`

_For more examples, please refer to the [Executing Workflows](https://nanoservice.xyz/docs/d/core-concepts/executing-workflows)_
